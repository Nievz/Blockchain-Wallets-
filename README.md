Welcome to the KryptoJobs2Go - Ethereum Integration project! In this endeavor, we have seamlessly integrated the Ethereum blockchain into the KryptoJobs2Go application, allowing users to instantly pay fintech professionals with cryptocurrency. This integration enhances the functionality of KryptoJobs2Go, making it a disruptive force in the world of fintech recruitment.


## Background

As part of our roles at KryptoJobs2Go, we were tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain into the application. KryptoJobs2Go is a revolutionary platform that connects fintech professionals with employers, facilitating the hiring process. Our mission was to enable customers to pay their hired fintech professionals instantly using cryptocurrency, thereby simplifying and accelerating payments.

## What We've Created

We are excited to share the successful integration of Ethereum into KryptoJobs2Go. Here's what we've accomplished:
## Instructions
# Step 1: Import Ethereum Transaction Functions

In this step, we integrated Ethereum transaction functions from the crypto_wallet.py file into the KryptoJobs2Go application. These functions include:

  1. generate_account: Creates an Ethereum account from a mnemonic seed phrase.
    
  2. get_balance: Retrieves the Ether balance of an Ethereum account.
    
  3. send_transaction: Sends an authorized transaction to the Ethereum blockchain.

We imported these functions and used them to provide wallet operations within the KryptoJobs2Go application. Users can now interact with Ethereum seamlessly.
# Step 2: Sign and Run a Payment Transaction

In this step, we implemented the code for users to calculate and initiate payments to fintech professionals. Users select a candidate from the application, specify the number of hours they want to hire the professional for, and the application calculates the payment in Ether based on the candidate's hourly rate.

We modified the application to send a transaction to pay the professional. Users authorize the transaction with their digital signature, and the payment is made instantly in cryptocurrency.
# Step 3: Inspect the Transaction in Ganache

To ensure the integrity and transparency of the payment process, we integrated Ganache, a blockchain simulator. Users can test the payment functionality within the KryptoJobs2Go application. After making a payment, they can inspect the transaction in Ganache to verify its details.
